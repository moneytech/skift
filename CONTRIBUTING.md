# Contributing

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue,
discord, or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change.

If you want your change merge by us here are some good do's and don'ts to try to stick to:
- Conform to the projet coding style. Please use `clang-format` with the `clang-format.txt` included with the project.
- When committing the first line of your commit message should be "category: Brief description of what's being changed". The "category" can be a subdirectory, but also something like "POSIX compliance" or "module-name". Whatever seems logical.
- Don't touch anything outside the stated scope of the PR.
- Don't iterate excessively on your design across multiple commits.

## Notes
- Assembly is compiled with **NASM** and use the **intel syntax**.
